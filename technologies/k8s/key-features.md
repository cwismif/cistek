Here's a summary of Kubernetes' key container orchestration features:

## Core Orchestration

**Pod Management:**
- Smallest deployable unit containing one or more containers
- Automatic scheduling across cluster nodes based on resource requirements
- Health checks and automatic restart of failed containers
- Shared storage and networking within pods

**Cluster Architecture:**
- Master-worker node architecture with distributed control plane
- etcd for distributed configuration storage and service discovery
- API server as the central management hub
- Scheduler for intelligent workload placement

## Service Management and Networking

**Service Discovery:**
- Built-in DNS-based service discovery
- Load balancing across pod replicas
- Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName

**Ingress and Traffic Management:**
- HTTP/HTTPS routing and SSL termination
- Path-based and host-based routing rules
- Integration with external load balancers and reverse proxies

**Network Policies:**
- Firewall rules for pod-to-pod communication
- Namespace-based network isolation
- Fine-grained traffic control using labels and selectors

## Scaling and Deployment

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):**
- Automatic scaling based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
- Integration with metrics servers and monitoring systems
- Support for multiple metrics simultaneously

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Rolling updates with zero-downtime deployments
- Blue-green and canary deployment patterns
- Rollback capabilities to previous versions
- StatefulSets for stateful applications with persistent identity

## Storage and Configuration

**Persistent Storage:**
- Dynamic volume provisioning with storage classes
- Support for cloud storage (AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk)
- Network-attached storage (NFS, iSCSI, Ceph)
- Container Storage Interface (CSI) for third-party storage drivers

**Configuration Management:**
- ConfigMaps for application configuration data
- Secrets for sensitive information (passwords, tokens, keys)
- Environment variable injection and file mounting
- Hot-reloading of configuration changes

## Workload Types

**Application Controllers:**
- Deployments for stateless applications
- StatefulSets for databases and stateful services
- DaemonSets for node-level services (monitoring, logging)
- Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing and scheduled tasks

**Resource Management:**
- CPU and memory requests and limits
- Quality of Service (QoS) classes for resource prioritization
- Node affinity and anti-affinity rules
- Taints and tolerations for specialized node scheduling

## Security Features

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Fine-grained permissions for users and service accounts
- Namespace-based access isolation
- Integration with external identity providers

**Security Policies:**
- Pod Security Standards for container security constraints
- Network policies for traffic isolation
- Admission controllers for policy enforcement
- Image security scanning integration

## Observability and Management

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- Built-in metrics collection and exposure
- Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools
- Centralized logging with log aggregation
- Distributed tracing support

**API and Extensibility:**
- RESTful API for all cluster operations
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for extending Kubernetes
- Operators for automated application management
- Helm package manager for application deployment

## Multi-Environment Support

**Cluster Federation:**
- Multi-cluster management and workload distribution
- Cross-cluster service discovery and networking
- Disaster recovery and high availability across regions

**Cloud Integration:**
- Native integration with major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Cloud-specific load balancers and storage solutions
- Managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS)

Kubernetes provides a comprehensive platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it the de facto standard for container orchestration in production environments.

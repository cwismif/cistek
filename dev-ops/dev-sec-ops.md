## DevSecOps
---
Integrating security management into the build workflow, staging, and production. 


#### Software implementation - 
This might be more security related than DevSecOps which is integrating security checks into DevOps workflows
APIs should be closely scrutinised. Validate all input and avoid whitelisting of endpoint paths until required.
Request interceptors can be used to perform some tasks. These could be packaged into a library for reuse and 
checked as a dependency by a pre-commit script.

#### Pre-commit hooks
Best to set these globally if you have lots of repos.
Multi stage build containers allow enforces consistent security processes.  Having a docker container in multiple stages  
Run on every developer's machine and allows scripts to run that identify problems before a commit (eg. regex that matches a string that looks like a secret!)  
In the Java ecosystem there is a tool called Spot Bugs with an Extension that also looks for security related bugs.
In the IaC ecosystem, source analysis such as tfsec can quickly feedback on potential infrastructure vulnerabilites.

#### Local CI
* Multi stage build containers allow containers to serve a specific part of the DevSecOps workflow, each with the minimal tooling that enables the container to serve the specific function of the security scan.  
* Faster feedback - many scans could be done before code is committed (pre-commit hooks) or pushed (pre-push hooks that execute after merging main).  
  This merge may introduce vulnerabilities that neither commits possessed alone. 
* The output of the local multi stage containerised CI workflow is an image that contains minimal only what it requires to function. This reduces the attack surface.
* Containers allow the runtime environment to be identical whether locally or in production (excluding configuration).  It is easier to reproduce vulnerabilities
  that caused checks to fail in remote CI.  Inversely, local CI catches vulnerabilites early, and feedback faster.  They also allow for easier investigation.
* SAST (scans source and compiled code), DAST (scans the application while executing), SCA (Critical, checks NVD for dependency vulnerabilities), container security scanning can all be accomplished with just the packaged jar.
* Containerised building also limits the scope of exploits that can emerge from malicious dependencies.

#### Build tooling
Whether maven or gradle, dependencies downloaded from the internet can be verified for tampering using checksums
Dependabot!!
#### Build workflows perform
Whether local or remote SAST analysis of source and compiled code needs to be passed. 
DAST is the analysis of vulnerabilities in an application while it is being executed. 
SCA where open-source dependencies are queried against vulnerability databases. Container image security scans analyse the container image using CVE and NST databases to identify vulnerabilities.   
Tooling includes: SonarQube, Snyk, Checkmarx, Black Duck, JFrog

#### SIEM - Security Information and Event Management
In production, SIEM, the real time analysis of application logs to identify attacks and trigger alerts. Tooling includes: DataDog, Splunk, Elastic Security - all of which ingest log events generally.  There are plenty of other tools.  

#### RASP - Runtime Application Self-Protection
Looks very promising as it operates by monitoring the runtime application and prevents malicious code from executing.  Some features suggest even zero-day attacks can be protected against. 

#### Personalaly identifiable information checks

#### Mutation testing

#### Secret management
Secrets are introduced through and external mechanism to repositores and would follow  

#### Access control
Now a bigger concern than ever.

#### Patch management
Part of vulnerability management and continuously addresses recently discovered vulnerabilities and applies patches to fix these vulnerabilities, which can be manually applied or an automated apply that goes through the build workflow.

#### Infrastructure
Since the web application is only a part of the attack surface, DevSecOps need to be involved in securing the infrastructure in their domain. 

* Networks can be secured by using subnets and controlling the traffic flowing between them.  Private subnets can host the most sensitive resources, with network ACLs giving fine-grained control of permitted traffic.    
* Firewalls can be applied to resources attached to the subnets, with their own explicit rules.  Hosts on the network also have their own firewalls.   
* In addition to this, a web application firewall (WAF) can block traffic at OSI L7 and can block attacks based on HTTP request  information such as SQL injection, cross-site forgery and cross-site scripting.  It can also use its rate-limiter to mitigate DDoS attacks.   
* Encryption of data at rest and encryption of data in transit should be standard.  Keys can be rotated automatically at a period selected (AWS defaults to yearly).  TLS 1.3 should be used within the network.  
* Use network traffic logs (eg. AWS VPC flow logs) to detect unusual traffic  
* Access Control:  principle of least privilege should be applied to access control, Permissions should be granted that allow the completion of a task but no more than that, and for only the period of time it takes to accomplish the task.  Taken literally this isnâ€™t very practical, but the essence is sensible.  There should be a limited number of engineers with the permissions to access and configure production; each engineer should have a limited domain.  2FA would grant more security for those with production access. In fact no one engineer, as senior as they are, ought to be given the power to bring down vital components of important systems.  
* Strong mechanisms for authenticating and authorising application clients.  Whitelists and deny-by-default rules are a secure practice but not always practical

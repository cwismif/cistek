**Sainsburys \-** DevOps Java Engineer	*London, UK | Oct 2022 to Apr 2025*

* Platform migration project: Led migration of 30 microservices between two Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) based on Kubernetes.  
* Migration benefits: The IDP being migrated from was decommissioned and saved the company $50,000 a year in AWS costs.    
* Two senior engineers saved hundreds of working hours a year.  
* Continuous Integration/Deployment migration: Led the CI/CD transformation from Jenkins to GitHub Actions, reducing the code line count by 80%.  
* Upgraded Primary Order Database: Planned and implemented an upgrade from AWS Aurora v2 (MySQL 5\) to v3 (MySQL 8\) the ‘System of Record’ database for customer orders. Using a blue/green deployment strategy meant there was no downtime.  

**Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, TDD, Hibernate, MySQL, AWS (SQS, SNS, Step Functions, Lambdas, DynamoDb, VPC, IAM, S3, RDS), Kubernetes (Helm, Istio),  GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins, Python, Javascript

**Ford UK \-** Full Stack Engineer	*London, UK | Aug 2021 to Sep 2022*

* Refactoring as part of the feature development: Advocated for clean code, refactoring while developing features to decrease tech debt incrementally.  
* Convinced the team and worked alongside another engineer to implement a GraphQL API alongside the current RESTful API.

**Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, TDD, API design, GraphQL (DGS), Hibernate

**Career break \-** Caring for family members	*Manchester, UK | Sep 2020 to Aug 2021*

**Sky \-** Senior Software Engineer	*London, UK | Mar 2020 to Sep 2020*

* TDD and pair programming microservices written in Kotlin.  
* Decreased latencies by 80% and resource usage by 50% compared to legacy services that used Java TomCat.

**Tech:** Kotlin (Ktor), Gradle, GraphQL, SQL, Docker

**Royal Bank of Scotland \-** Software Engineer	*London, UK | Sep 2018 to Feb 2020*

* Ownership over microservices: Led the design and implementation of two distinct microservices that secured 6 million customer transactions a day.   
* Minimised duplication by using common libraries, reducing total lines of code by 75%.  
* Used Python for various operational tasks \- such as data migration and data parsing.  
* Designed and implemented Event Driven Java frameworks: Decreased resource consumption by 50% by using HTTP microservices based on VertX and latency was reduced by 90% for some endpoints.

**Tech:** Java, Python, Spring Boot, AWS Elasticache (Redis) and DynamoDB, VertX, Terraform, REST APIs, OAuth, Swagger, Public Key Cryptography

**Sky \-** Software Engineer	*London, UK | Nov 2017 to Sep 2018*

* Implemented microservice features using TDD and pair programming.  
* Designed the system to be distributed and event driven so that it remained performant despite 10x spikes in traffic throughout the day.

**Tech:** Java (Spring Boot, RxJava), Kafka, Websockets, Python, Kubernetes

**Amalytics Ltd \-** Full stack Software/DevOps Engineer	*London, UK | Mar 2016 to Nov 2017*

* A small startup of 3-5 engineers: A single MVP was being developed that ingested accountancy data.  
* FinOps role: Reduced AWS costs by 75% by scheduling pausing or otherwise disabling services not in use.  
* DevOps role: Designed and implemented a single Jenkins node for CI.  
* Frontend developer role: Implemented the browser-based application using AngularJS, HTML and CSS.  
* Backend developer role: Data modelling, API design and implementation, Hibernate client implementation.  
* Performance Tuning: Used JVM profiling tools such as JMeter and Java Flight Recorder to reduce computation time by 95% (frequent GC). Remedies were to prefer primitives over Objects,  reuse of Objects via Object pooling, not using libraries that result in the heap growth.

**Tech:** Java, Javascript (Node.js, AngularJS), Python, Elasticsearch, SQL, Docker, Jenkins

**British Airways \-** Junior Full stack Software Engineer	*London, UK | Mar 2014 to Mar 2016*

* Implemented an Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK) stack.  
* Designed failover architecture: Two identical stacks in 2 different data centres \- both functioned independently and were configured as hot-cold \- all traffic went to a single stack unless of failover .  
* Implemented widgets and features using AngularJS, Java and Redis.

**Tech:** Java, Spring, Redis, Javascript (AngularJS), HTML, CSS
